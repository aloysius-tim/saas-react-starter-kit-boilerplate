Built on top of  [Adonis JS](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework) for the BackEnd and [React Starter Kit][https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit] for the Front-End it helped me to stay productive and follow the best practices.

>
> - The boilerplate app comes with many basic SaaS features (see [Features](https://github.com/async-labs/saas#features) below) so that you are able to focus on features that differentiate your product.
> - I tried to be as generic as possible for all SaaS use case - Trial or not / Free plan or not / Social signup or not / ...
